#ï»¿ No-JSX

A customizable and declarative interface for creating [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) components without *JSX* syntax.

If you love *React* but don't quite like the embeded *HTML* tags this library may be what you are looking for.

```js
const myView () =>
  div('.App')(
    div('.App-header')(
      img('.App-logo')({src: logo, alt:'logo'}),
      h2('Welcome to NJSX')
    )
  )()
```

## Installation

*NJSX* is available as the `njsx` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Just run the following line in your project root:

```bash
npm install njsx --save
```

## Usage

*NJSX* provides a series of builder functions to cleanly instantiate *React* or *React Native* components. Just import the components you need from right module and you are ready to go.

```js
// React project
import {div, p} from 'njsx/react'

// React Native project
import {View, Text} from 'njsx/react-native'
```


### Building Components

Each imported *NJSX* builder is a function that once applied with no arguments will yield a **React Component**.

```jsx
import {div} from 'njsx/react'

const someDiv = <div></div>
const anEqualDiv = div()
// These two lines yield the same!
```

If the builders are applied with one or more arguments, these will be used to configure the generated components. Each builder can be applied any number of times (up until you apply it with no arguments to construct the component).

```jsx
import {p} from 'njsx/react'

p('some text')()
p('some', ' ', 'text')()
p('some ')('text')()
p(['some', ' '],['text'])()

//All these lines yield the same component
<p>some text</p>
```

Each argument is process by a set of configurable rules to decide what change it represents for the component. Here are some examples of argument applications you can use right out of the box:

  - **Hashes** will become component's properties.

    ```jsx
    img({src: somePath, onClick: someCallback})
    ```

    Applying a builder with a second hash will result in the new properties merging with the old, keeping the later in case of repetition.

    ```jsx
    img({src: thisWillBeLost, onClick: thisWillRemain})({src: thisWillOverrideThePreviousPath})
    ```

  - **Strings**, **Numbers**, **Booleans**, **React Components** and even other **NJSX Builders** will become childrens.

    ```jsx
    div(
      div('the answer is ', 42)  // <- No need for building
    )()
    ```

    Notice that, since builders can be children too, most of the time there is no need to apply them with no args to create components.

  - **Strings starting with a dot** will be interpreted as a *classes*.

    ```jsx
    div('.thisIsAClass .thisIsAnotherClass')(
      'Some content'
    )
    ```

  - **Null** and **Undefined** arguments are ignored.


Any unsuported argument application will raise a `TypeError`.


## Advanced Customization

You don't like the way arguments are being handled? No problem! You can customize the rules *NJSX* uses for interpreting arguments to fine tune it to your needs. Add or remove supported argument applications, change the way they are processed or throw all away and start from scratch!

```js
import njsx from 'njsx/njsx'   // This is NJSX core. Booth React and ReactNative use it to define their builders.
import Rules from 'njsx/rules' // This module exports some common rule examples.
```

Each *rule* is just an array with two functions. The first one tells if the rule can handle an argument, the other one extracts any property or child from it.

```js
Rules.STRING_AS_CHILD = [
  arg => typeof arg === 'string', // This rule only applies to arguments of type string.
  arg => [ {}, [arg] ]            // Applying this rule adds the string to the children array (but it doesn't change the properties).
]
```

So you could easily create, for example, a rule that can handle anything that defines a `toString()` function and adds its result as a child.

```js
const strigableAsChild = [
  arg => arg.toString && typeof(arg.toString) === 'function',
  arg => [ {}, [arg.toString()] ]
]

njsx.rules.push(stringableAsChild) // From now on, all builders will support this rule.
```

Take into account that **only one** rule will be applied to each argument, and each rule will be tried in same order as it appears in the `njsx.rules` array, so be carefull to leave the more generic rules at the bottom.
